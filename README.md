# first_time_school_principalship

This study investigates the school leadership pipeline, focusing on the transition from teaching to first-time principalship in Chile. Drawing on population-level data from 2003 to 2022, the study examines when teachers transition into principalship and how individual and school characteristics influence this transition. Using event history analysis, the research details experience range-specific survival functions and hazard functions to illustrate the rolling likelihood of becoming a principal. A discrete-time hazard model is employed to incorporate individual traits and school characteristics. Preliminary results highlight notable patterns in the transition to principalship, with gender, and type of school administration, among other factors, playing crucial roles. Notably, despite the predominantly female teaching workforce, female educators demonstrate slower progression into principalship, especially in public schools, pointing towards systemic biases. There is a need for policy changes to ensure equitable opportunities for aspiring leaders, resonating with previous research on the school leadership pipeline.
